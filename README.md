## ‚ú® Installation

See the [Release Page](https://github.com/Creator-SN/MathFX/releases).

## üî® Tutorial

First, you need to set up the subscriptions, MathFX currently supports three formulate OCR APIs. Including:

1. **SLatex OCR** **(Recommend)**: To build your own backend server, you can deploy the OCR server in this repo [SLatexOCR](https://github.com/aleversn/sLatexOCR).
2. **Mathpix**: You can register the OCR API services with `$1` started, and the current pricing is much cheaper than directly using the Mathpix desktop application, each month you can have a `1,000` free requests. (`Although it costs $1 to sign up and a Credit Card is necessary, but the performance of this API is currently the best`).  [See Details](https://mathpix.com/ocr)
3. **Xunfei** Formula Recognition API: You can register the OCR API for free and obtain a `500` requests per day. [See Details](https://www.xfyun.cn/service/formula-discern)
4. **Baidu** Formula Recognition API: You can register the OCR API for free and obtain a `1,000` requests per month. [See Details](https://ai.baidu.com/tech/ocr/formula)

> Note that the performance of `Xunfei` and `Baidu` OCR API is not good in complex science formulates scenes.

Once you have an OCR API subscription, all you need to do is fill in the necessary information about the current subscription. Then click this subscription's item block until the block's border is `blue`.

Now you can scan for a new formulate scene on the `Scan` page or press `Alt + Shift/Cmd + X` to quick scan.

## ‚å® Shortcuts

- `Alt` + `Shift/Cmd` + `M`: Show the main program.
- `Alt` + `Shift/Cmd` + `X`: Start a new quick scan.
