## ✨ Installation

See the [Release Page](https://github.com/Creator-SN/MathFX/releases).

## 🔨 Tutorial

First, you need to set up the subscriptions, MathFX currently support three formulate OCR APIs. Incluing:

1. **Mathpix** **(Recommend)**: You can register the OCR API services with `$1` started, and the current pricing is much cheaper than directly using the Mathpix desktop application, each month you can have a `1,000` free requests. (`Although it costs $1 to sign up and a Credit Card is necessary, but the performance of this API is currently the best`).  [See Details](https://mathpix.com/ocr)
2. **Xunfei** Formula Recognition API: You can register the OCR API for free and obtain a `500` requests per day. [See Details](https://www.xfyun.cn/service/formula-discern)
3. **Baidu** Formula Recognition API: You can register the OCR API for free and obtain a `1,000` requests per month. [See Details](https://ai.baidu.com/tech/ocr/formula)

> Note that the performance of `Xunfei` and `Baidu` OCR API is not good in complex science formulates scenes.

Once you have a OCR API subscription, all you need to do is fill the necessary information of the current subscription. Then click this subscrption's item block until the block's border is `blue`.
